# Project Overview
In this project, you'll use the [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) library to train several models for the [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview) competition in Kaggle. You will be using [Tabular Prediction](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular_prediction/index.html#) to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project will demonstrate your ability to use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and record your personal optimization of the problem.

Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In the end, you will have submitted several entries to the competition and achieved a rank within Kaggle. You will also complete a report of your findings that you can share publicly on Kaggle or your personal page, providing a way to showcase your work.
